## Installing/Configuring
These are not comprehensive instructions. However, Node-based bots are fairly straightforward to install. You need the latest version of Node.js installed to run the bot.

1. Clone the repository onto the computer you want to run from.
2. From the command line, run `npm install` to install the required packages.
3. Make a copy of `config.js.example` and rename it to `config.js`. Replace the owner ID with your user ID, and the token with your bot's token. Replace the prefix with a prefix of your choice.
4. From the command line, run `npm start` to launch the bot. Make sure to invite it to your server.
