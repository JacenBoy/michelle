## Inviting Michelle
If you want to add Michelle to your server, you can do so using [this invite link](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=536935359775506444&scope=bot&permissions=379968). Use `m-help` to get started using the bot. Alternatively, you can self-host the bot if you want.

## Installing/Configuring
Since the code is open source, you are free to host Michelle locally yourself if you prefer. These are not comprehensive instructions for self-hosting. However, Node-based bots are fairly straightforward to install. You need the latest version of Node.js installed to run the bot.

1. Clone the repository onto the computer you want to run from.
2. From the command line, run `npm install` to install the required packages.
3. Make a copy of `config.js.example` and rename it to `config.js`. Replace the owner ID with your user ID, and the token with your bot's token. Replace the prefix with a prefix of your choice.
4. From the command line, run `npm start` to launch the bot. Make sure to invite it to your server.

## Help
If you have trouble with the bot, you can contact me on [Twitter (@jacenboy)](https://twitter.com/jacenboy), on [my Discord server](https://discord.gg/6wgy6jE), or by opening a bug report here on GitHub.
